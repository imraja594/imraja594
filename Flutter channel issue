You might need to Update your pubspec.yaml depending on the flutter channel you want to work on:

If you are on stable channel :

Go into pubspec.yaml and type in:

environment:
  sdk: ">=2.2.0 <3.0.0"
(Whatever Dart SDK version you want comes in the front)

dependencies:
  cupertino_icons: ^1.0.0
If you are on beta channel :

environment:
      sdk: ">=2.12.0 <3.0.0"

dependencies:
  cupertino_icons: ^1.0.1
Then if you are on stable channel (or beta), open the terminal in your IDE and enter

flutter channel stable
# or flutter channel beta
flutter upgrade
flutter pub get
Check the version with flutter --version

Hope it helps.
