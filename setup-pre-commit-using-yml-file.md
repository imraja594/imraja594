Here's how to set up pre-commit in Git using the `.pre-commit-config.yml` file:

**Prerequisites:**

* **Install `pre-commit`:** Use `pip install pre-commit` to install the package.

**Steps:**

1. **Create the configuration file:**
   - In your Git repository's root directory, create a file named `.pre-commit-config.yml`.

2. **Define pre-commit hooks:**
   - Open the `.pre-commit-config.yml` file and specify the pre-commit hooks you want to use. Each hook entry consists of:
     - **'repo':** URL of the pre-commit hook repository (e.g., for code formatting, you can use `'repo': https://github.com/psf/black'`).
     - **'rev':** (Optional) Specific revision of the hook repository.
     - **'args':** (Optional) List of arguments to pass to the hook.

   **Example:**

   ```yaml
   repos:
     - repo: https://github.com/psf/black
       rev: 22.3.0  # Optional: Specify revision
     - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pygrep-hooks
       rev: v1.9.0  # Optional: Specify revision
       args: ["--pattern=.*\.py"]  # Optional: Arguments
   ```

   You can find a variety of pre-commit hooks for tasks like code formatting, linting, and static analysis in the pre-commit hooks repository: [https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks).

3. **Install hooks:**
   - After defining the hooks in the configuration file, run the following command in your terminal:

     ```bash
     pre-commit install
     ```

   This installs the necessary hooks and sets them up to run automatically before each commit.

**Additional notes:**

* You can use `pre-commit sample-config` to generate a basic configuration file as a starting point.
* After modifying the `.pre-commit-config.yml` file, you might need to run `pre-commit install` again to update the hooks.

By following these steps, you'll have pre-commit integrated into your Git workflow, enforcing code quality checks before each commit.
